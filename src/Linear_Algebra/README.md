# Linear algebra module

This is the core part of the project, wherin all the functions of linear algebra are defined
som as to be used in the visualizer

# OBJECTIVES of classes to create

Here we aim to produce optimal codes that can work on the visualizer

* Solving a linear equation
* Finding eigenvectors
* Vector Projections
* Decompositions
    * LU / LDU - Decomposing a square matrix into Lower triangular and upper triangular matrix
    * QR  -
    * Eigen decomposition -  
    * SVD - 
* Gram-Schimidit orthonormalisation
