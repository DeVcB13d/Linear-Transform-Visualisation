# Visualizing Linear Transformations

1. **What we aim to do here**

Linear transfors are one of the core concepts in linear algebra. A large number of concepts in linear algebra can be understood with a great understanding of the linear transforms. Through this project, we aim to create a tool that would help in the visualization of linear algebra concepts through linear transformations in the 2D coordinate plane.

2. **Project design**

We aim to design a 2D cartesian plane with the help of pygame library. Features that we aim to give:

1. 2D plane
